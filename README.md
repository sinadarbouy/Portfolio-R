## Description of the data
The data [Empirical-Software-Engineering](W. Afzal, A. N. Ghazi, J. Itkonen,
R. Torkar, A. Andrews, and K. Bhatti.
An experiment on the effectiveness
and efficiency of exploratory testing.

10.1007/s10664-014-9301-4 "Empirical Software Engineering") is from an experiment where 70 subjects participated. Of the 70, 46 subjects were categorized as less experienced (LE) and 24 were categorized as more experienced (ME). The experiment evaluated two software testing techniques, i.e., a new technique (NT) and an old technique (OT), used a small, noncritical system as the software under test, and had a 2 × 2 design to avoid learning bias. The effectiveness of each technique was measured through true positives (tp).
